# Authenticating Users

We'll use this project as a starting point for exploring how to authenticate users in an application.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).  The first time you run it, don't forget to install needed dependencies by running `npm install`.  Then, you can run the development server like so:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
